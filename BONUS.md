Bonus Features:

- A complete form to add questions that are valid and able to be used in a game straight away. (Expanding the point "This screen allows users to delete a particular question, or add a new question") This form is able to add questions in full, including points, correct answer, other answers etc so users can add questions and get going straight away. I went above and beyonnd here to enhance usability

- The use of check boxes in the edit question page to indicate which answer(s) is correct. Again went above and beyond to improve usability as checking boxes is a very intuitive and clean way to indicate which answers are correct. This supports multiple answers options which added alot of additional state management, and data transformation to function seamlessly.

- Back buttons and nav bar to enhance user experience

- Creation of clean modals to highlight any errors or messages to the admin, not requires by the spec at all.

- Overall thoughtfully designed user interface and experience using Material UI to create a clean and usable kahoot clone that is very intuitive. All pages have aesthetically pleasing padding and all cards are clickable. Questions/games are also deleted and added live which gives users direct feedback. Using material UI gave me a huge amount of trouble when testing as material UI "masks" traditional html tags and so it is hard to access these.
