UI Improvements:
- Learnt/used the material UI library to give components a modern look and give extra feedback when clicking buttons and input fields
- Easy to navigate buttons on each game, very intuitive to start/stop/advance a game
- Users are able to input a fully functioning question after clicking on a game
- When editing a question the use of checkboxes which denote the correct answers are very easy to use and intuitive
- On result screens minimalistic tables are used to convey individual and overall results for the player and the admin user
- Overall all screens are responsive, clean, simple and very easy to use with out prior instruction. 
- Usage of 12 column grids to place information and at the very least centre the hero component on each page as per lectures
- h tags are used in increasing fashion

UX Improvements:
- Admins essentially have access to 4 main screens which make navigation extremely simple
- The nav bar with home/dashboard and logout links are very convenient. 
- Also when editing questions or games a back button exists to redirect users.
- Questions and games are displayed as easy to understand cards and are all accessible via clicking anywhere on the card and can all be deleted with live updates
- Adding questions or new games are all updated live, providing feed back straight away
- Error handling, feed back and modals are present throughout the web app covering many use cases and allowing the user to address and avoid errors.

Acessibility:
- Aria labels have been used for components with no text, for example the cross mark to close cards.
- alt tags are used for images that are present in the dashboard and when games are played (essentially every image has one)
- Labels exist for text inputs and thus allow screen readers to pick up what inputs are for what field
- Colours have sufficient contrast being white, strong blue and red.
